# Differential-drive-robot-control
Navigation to goal position using Finite State Machine(FSM) in a cluttered environment.

### Simulator and toolbox ###
* The control strategies are implemented in the [Sim.I.am](http://gritslab.gatech.edu/home/2013/10/sim-i-am/) simulator.
* GUI Layout Toolbox is required to run Sim.I.am simulator.

### installing GUI Layout Toolbox ###
* Go to [GUI Layout Toolbox](https://in.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/47982-gui-layout-toolbox).
* On the upper-right, click the “Download Toolbox” button. A dialog will appear prompting you to select a location for saving the file GUI Layout Toolbox 2.1.2.mltbx.
* Open MATLAB and navigate to the folder where the GUI Layout Toolbox 2.1.2.mltbx file was saved. Double click on this file.
* Install the toolbox.

### Objectives ###
* Implement Obstacle avoidance, go to goal, and follow wall control strategies and develop a Finite state Machine(FSM) to navigate to a goal position in a cluttered environment.

### How to use ###
* Clone the repository
* run the **launch.m** file and click on the play button.
